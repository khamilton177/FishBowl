# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version- 2.4.0

* System dependencies- rails and gems listed in Gemfile

This is an app similar to Tumbler.  Users can login, write posts, comment on other users' posts.
